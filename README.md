# Wild T2 theodolite mirror holder

2025-06-14 first version

3D printable model of the mirror holder for old Wild T2 theodolites, which are still used by Waldrf-Steiner schools on their surveying classes. It's an easy to loose and hard to find replacement part

Should be run on jscad then exported to a 3d printable format such as .stl. There's also a ready to print .stl file in the repository, if you don't want to bother all the details. You'll need a 1"=25.4mm round mirror, which you can find on temu.com

Made for https://github.com/jscad/. Should work on openjscad.xyz and jscad.app. Doesn't work on neorama.de/openjscad.org which apparently uses an old version of JSCad.

How to use it: 
- https://openjscad.xyz
- click the pencil on the top right
- copy the contents of theodolite-mirror.js from this repository and paste it into the edit box that opens up on the web site
- Shift-Enter to process it
- click the Export button to generate the 3d printable format suitable for your printer
